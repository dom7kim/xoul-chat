      "How do rising prices (like Lunchflation in Korea) affect your social life, routines, or the way you plan your day?",

    "context": "In many Korean schools, subjects like music, art, and PE—what we call the arts and physical education (예체능)—are often seen as less important than academic ones.

Around the world, creative and physical education is linked to empathy, creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. In this session, let’s explore how 예체능 has influenced our lives—and why it might be more essential now than ever in the age of AI.",
    "questions": [
      "What was your favorite subject among the arts and physical education (예체능) when you were in school? How did it make you feel back then?",
      "Did your school encourage these subjects, or were they treated as less important? How did that influence your attitude toward 예체능?",
      "Can you remember a time when music, art, or physical activity helped you understand your emotions or a situation better? What was that experience like?",
      "Do you think the arts and physical education should be seen as part of 'real' education, not just extra activities? Why or why not?",
      "If you could go back and master any skill in 예체능, what would you choose—and how do you think it would change your life now?"
