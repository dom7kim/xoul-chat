  "Session 2: Lost in Abbreviation 🤯": {
    "context": "Whether it’s texting with friends or navigating office life, abbreviations have become a natural part of how we communicate in Korea. Expressions like “ㅋㅋ,” “갑분싸,” “PM,” or “ASAP” aim to make things quicker and cooler—but they can also lead to misunderstandings, social pressure, or even anxiety when we don’t quite “get it.” In this session, let’s explore the world of abbreviations: how we use them, how they shape our conversations, and how they sometimes affect our confidence or sense of belonging.",
    "questions": [
      "What’s one abbreviation—either in Korean or English—that you use often? What does it mean to you, and when do you usually use it?",
      "Have you ever felt confused or left out because someone used an abbreviation or slang term you didn’t understand? How did you react in that moment?",
      "Do you think abbreviations help people feel closer and more casual, or do they sometimes create distance between people? Why?",
      "In fast-paced group chats or work messages, do you ever feel pressure to respond quickly—even if you’re not sure what something means? How does that kind of communication affect your emotions?",
      "If you could create a brand-new abbreviation that perfectly expresses a personal feeling or daily situation, what would it be? (What emotion or idea would it capture?)"

  "Session 3: Secondhand, First Choice? ♻️": {
    "context": "Once seen as something only for bargain hunters or those in need, secondhand shopping is now a booming lifestyle trend—especially among younger Koreans. From luxury bags on Karrot (당근마켓) to eco-friendly outfits on Bunjang (번개장터), it’s about more than just saving money. Secondhand culture today involves sustainability, personal expression, emotional storytelling, and even digital resales. Let’s explore how “used” items can reflect fresh values, surprising stories, and smart choices.",
    "questions": [
      "What’s the most interesting or meaningful secondhand item you’ve ever owned or seen? (It could be something you bought, received, or even passed on!)",
      "Have you ever felt proud, awkward, or excited about using or gifting something secondhand? (What emotions come up when you think about pre-owned items?)",
      "Why do you think secondhand shopping is becoming more popular in Korea, especially among younger people? (Do you see it more as a financial choice, a trend, or a lifestyle value?)",
      "Would you ever buy secondhand luxury goods or digital items like a used smartphone or game account? Why or why not? (What are the deal-breakers or deal-makers for you?)",
      "Do you think secondhand shopping will become more common in the future? Or is it just a trend? (What might encourage—or discourage—more people from choosing secondhand?)"
