    "questions": [
      "Think of a time when you were rushing somewhere important but still stopped to help someone â€“ what was going through your mind? Was it worth the delay?",
      "Have you ever caught yourself using 'I'm too busy' as an excuse to avoid helping someone, then felt guilty about it later? What happened?",
      "If your friends secretly rated your generosity on a scale of 1-10, what score would they give you, and would that score change depending on how busy you are?",
      "Imagine you won the lottery and suddenly had all the time and money in the world â€“ how would your acts of kindness change? Would you become the neighborhood hero or still guard your resources?",

      "When traveling to new places, have you noticed your perception changing over time? How was your experience different between the first few days and later in your stay?",
      "What strategies have you used (or could you use) to maintain enthusiasm after the initial excitement fades, whether in relationships, new jobs, or travel experiences?",
