  "Session 1: Better to Bend or Break? Finding Balance in Life üå≥": {
    "context": "The proverb 'Better to bend than to break' highlights the value of flexibility and adaptability, suggesting that sometimes compromising or adjusting our approach can help us overcome challenges without losing what matters most. For instance, in the workplace, being open to new ideas or unexpected changes can lead to growth and innovation, while excessive rigidity might result in missed opportunities or conflicts. However, there are also situations‚Äîlike standing firm on personal values or ethical principles‚Äîwhere bending might not be an option. Today, let's share our experiences and perspectives to explore how we navigate these choices between flexibility and firmness.",
    "questions": [
      "Think of a recent situation‚Äîperhaps at work, school, or in a relationship‚Äîwhere you decided to 'bend' rather than stand firm. What motivated your decision, and were you satisfied with the outcome?",
      "Have you ever witnessed someone being too rigid or inflexible in a crisis or challenging situation? What happened as a result?",

  "Session 3: Stanning (ÎçïÏßà): Passion or Obsession? üåü": {
    "context": "The term *stan* originated from Eminem's 2000 song 'Stan,' which tells the story of an overly devoted fan whose obsession leads to tragic consequences. Over time, the word has evolved to describe intense enthusiasm or dedication‚Äînot just for celebrities, but also for hobbies and interests. Stanning can be a source of joy and connection, fostering creativity and community. However, it also has a darker side when passion turns into unhealthy obsession or toxic behavior. Whether you‚Äôve passionately followed a favorite artist, immersed yourself in a hobby, or observed stanning culture online or among friends, it‚Äôs something many of us can relate to. Let‚Äôs explore its impact on our lives and share stories about what we love‚Äîand what we‚Äôve seen.",

      "In your opinion, what are the positive aspects of stanning? Have you seen examples where it helped people connect, grow, or express themselves?",
      "Have you ever noticed stanning go too far‚Äîeither in your own experience or through things like social media? What do you think causes this shift from passion to obsession?",
      "If you could create a fandom for something unique (like an underrated hobby or idea), what would it be about? How would you make it fun and inclusive for others?"
