    "context": "We often hear that 'quality is more important than quantity,' but many creators, from artists to entrepreneurs, have found success by producing a high volume of workâ€”embracing trial, error, and learning along the way. This session explores how repetition, practice, and even failure can lead to excellence in various areas of life, including creativity, relationships, and growth.",
    "questions": [
      "Whatâ€™s something youâ€™ve done many times that helped you get really good at it? Even small things like cooking, gaming, or giving presentations count!",
      "Can you share a time when you failed or felt unsatisfied with your effort, but later realized it helped you improve? How did that experience shape your confidence or skill?",
      "Do you agree that quality comes through quantity? Or do you believe some people just 'have it' from the beginning? Why do you feel that way?",
      "In your personal or professional life, do you feel pressure to get things right the first time? How do you usually handle that pressure?",

      "Have you ever felt that a message you received was 'too cold' or 'too emotional'? What gave you that impression?",
      "How do you try to sound friendly, serious, or polite in your texts? Do you ever worry about being misunderstood?",
      "In your opinion, whatâ€™s the role of emojis or punctuation in texting today? Are they just decorations, or something more?",
      "If texting was an art form, what would your personal 'style' be? Minimalist? Playful? Dramatic?"
