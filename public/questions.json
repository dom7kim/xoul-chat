  "Session 1: Brands We Loved, Brands We Left 🛍️": {
    "context": "From sneakers to social media, brands have long influenced our identities, behaviors, and social circles. This session explores the personal and cultural journeys behind the brands we once loved—and those we eventually left behind.",
    "questions": [
      "What’s a brand you were obsessed with as a teen or in your early 20s? What made it so cool or meaningful back then?",
      "Have you ever completely stopped using a brand you used to love? What made you turn away—was it the product, the image, the price, or something else?",
      "What do you think makes a brand feel “authentic” or trustworthy today? Is it design, values, influencers, or your own experience?",
      "Can a brand really make a comeback after losing popularity? What does it take for you to give a second chance—just rebranding, or real change?",
      "If you could create your own dream brand, what would it sell and what would it stand for? Think about the vibe, mission, and customer experience."

  "Session 2: More Than Just a Smile 🙂": {
    "context": "Smiles are powerful—and sometimes puzzling. This session dives into how smiles are used across cultures and contexts, what they really mean, and how they influence relationships and communication.",
    "questions": [
      "Have you ever been told something about your smile—or your lack of one? (Was it a compliment, a joke, a critique? How did it make you feel?)",
      "Has anyone ever misread your smile and thought you were flirting—or more interested than you actually were? (Or have you ever misread someone else’s smile and made a funny assumption?)",
      "Do you think Koreans smile more or less than people in other countries you’ve visited or lived in? Why do you think that is?",
      "Is it possible to smile too much—or not enough—in daily life, at work, or online? (Have you ever felt pressure to smile in a certain situation?)",
      "If people could no longer use facial expressions to show emotions, how do you think the world would change? (Would we be more honest—or more confused?)"
