    "context": "This session explores the personal and social dimensions of routines, examining how structure and discipline influence our daily lives. From curated morning rituals to the tools we use to stay organized, we'll reflect on what routines mean to us and how we navigate habit-building in a world full of both inspiration and pressure.",
    "questions": [
      "What does your ideal daily routine look like—and how close is it to your real life? Are you more of a strict planner or someone who prefers going with the flow?",
      "Have you ever tried following a set routine for something—like studying, exercising, or taking a break from your phone? What was it like, and did it have any lasting impact?",
      "These days, many people post 'aesthetic' routines online—early wake-ups, journaling, cold showers. Do you find these inspiring or unrealistic? How do they influence your own approach to discipline?",
      "Some people use digital tools like Notion, habit trackers, or gamified apps to build routines. Have you used any of these? What helped you stay consistent—or what didn’t work?",
      "What do you think matters more: motivation or discipline? How do you stay on track when you don’t feel like doing something?"

  "Session 3: Cold Comforts and Cool Trends 🍧🍜": {
    "context": "In this session, we delve into Korea's contrasting summer food trends—from ultra-convenient cup bingsu and instant naengmyeon to upscale, nostalgic dishes served in restaurants and hotels. We'll discuss how these foods connect to broader shifts in culture, convenience, and lifestyle, and what they reveal about modern Korean society.",
    "questions": [
      "Have you ever tried cup bingsu or instant naengmyeon? What did you think of it—was it refreshing, disappointing, or surprisingly good? How does it compare to the “real” version?",
      "When you’re hot and tired in the summer, which do you usually crave—something fast and easy like a convenience store dessert, or a full sit-down meal with cold noodles or fancy bingsu? Why?",
      "Some people say convenience foods like these lose their traditional soul. Do you agree—or do you think they’re just evolving with the times?",
      "Imagine you could design your dream version of bingsu or naengmyeon—what ingredients or style would you choose? Would it be more modern or traditional?",
      "These food trends reflect bigger changes in Korean society—like more single-person households, rising prices, and time-saving habits. Do you see yourself affected by these trends in your daily life? How?"
