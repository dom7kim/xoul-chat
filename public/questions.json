  "Session 1: Crossing the Chasm 🌉": {
    "context": "This session explores the gap between early adopters who eagerly try new trends and the mainstream majority who wait until something becomes established. It invites participants to reflect on their own experiences with hype, trend adoption, and what helps ideas move from niche to norm.",
    "questions": [
      "What’s something you tried or bought because of hype? Was it a great decision—or not so much?",
      "Have you ever felt like you were ahead of others when discovering something new? How did people around you react?",
      "Why do you think some people love trying new things early, while others prefer to wait and see? Which group do you relate to more?",
      "What helps a trend “cross the chasm” and become part of everyday life? Can you think of an example that succeeded—or one that didn’t?",
      "If you were launching the next big trend, what would it be—and how would you help it cross the chasm? Think big or fun!"

  "Session 2: Human Touch in the Age of Machines 🤖❤️": {
    "context": "This session delves into the importance of human connection in an increasingly digital and automated world. It encourages reflection on the small, meaningful interactions that bring warmth to daily life and explores how to preserve emotional resonance as technology continues to evolve.",
    "questions": [
      "When was the last time you had a small but meaningful human interaction in your day-to-day life? Like a smile from a stranger, a kind message, or someone remembering your name?",
      "Now think about a recent experience with technology—did it feel cold and robotic, or somehow warm and thoughtful?",
      "What do you think we might lose if human touch disappears from more parts of daily life?",
      "Are there ways we can bring more “human-ness” into our digital lives?",
      "Imagine it’s the year 2040. What kind of “human touch” do you hope still exists—and where would you fight to keep it?"
