  "Session 2: Beyond the Moral – Rethinking Folktales 🐢🐇": {
    "context": "Folktales are more than just bedtime stories—they're cultural blueprints packed with moral lessons. From The Tortoise and the Hare to Heungbu and Nolbu, these tales often teach us how to behave, what to value, and what kind of person to admire. But what happens when we revisit these stories as adults? Do the morals still hold up, or do we see them differently now? In this session, we’ll explore familiar folktales from fresh angles and reflect on what they reveal about our evolving beliefs and identities.",
    "questions": [
      "What’s a folktale you remember from your childhood? How did it make you feel or what lesson did you take from it back then?",
      "Have you ever questioned the message of a story you learned as a child? For example, some people say the tortoise wasn’t just patient—he ignored the hare to win. Has your view of any story or character changed over time?",
      "Do you think folktales from your culture usually teach values like obedience, kindness, or patience? How do those messages compare to Western stories, where characters often value independence, bravery, or breaking the rules?",
      "If you could rewrite a classic tale to reflect your own beliefs or today’s world, what would you change—and why? (Would you give the villain a voice? Would you alter the ending?)",
      "Do you think we still need folktales in today’s society? Or have newer forms of storytelling (like K-dramas, webtoons, or social media) taken over that role?"

  "Session 3: Do We Have to Earn Our Joy? Rethinking the Meaning of Travel ✈️": {
    "context": "In Korea’s high-pressure, work-focused culture, travel is often framed as a valuable “experience” only if it leads to growth, productivity, or self-discovery. But what if joy, rest, or curiosity were reasons enough? In this session, we’ll explore how we view travel — as escape, compensation, personal growth, or pure pleasure — and challenge the idea that we always need to “justify” our joy.",
    "questions": [
      "When you think about your most recent trip, what made it special or memorable for you? Was it the place, the people, or simply the break from routine?",
      "Have you ever felt pressure to explain why your trip was “meaningful” or “worth it”? Where do you think that pressure comes from?",
      "Do you believe that travel can truly change a person — or is that just a romantic idea? What kind of travel (if any) has shaped your thinking or lifestyle?",
      "What’s your opinion on the idea that travel is just consumption, not experience? Do you see travel more as emotional investment, a reward, or a way to grow?",
      "If you had one month off and unlimited funds, would you choose to travel for adventure, comfort, learning, or something else? What does your choice say about what you value most right now?"
