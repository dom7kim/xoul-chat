  "Session 1: Can Your Face Tell Your Fortune? 🔮": {
    "context": "In traditional Korean culture, gwansang—the art of face reading—claims that your facial features reveal your personality, destiny, and even luck. This ancient practice still finds a place in modern life, from casual conversations to pop culture. But how do these beliefs translate across cultures, especially when a Korean face reader interprets a foreigner’s face? Let’s explore the surprising intersections of tradition, identity, and first impressions through the lens of facial features.",
    "questions": [
      "Have you ever had your face 'read' by someone—seriously or just for fun? What did they say, and how did you feel about it?",
      "Do you think our facial features can actually reflect something about our personalities or life paths? Why or why not?",
      "When you first meet someone, how much do you think their appearance shapes your first impression of them? Are there features you find yourself unconsciously reacting to?",
      "Gwansang was used in the past to pick leaders or predict someone’s future—do you think traditional beliefs like this still hold power today? Should they?",
      "If someone read your face and told you it showed a completely different personality from what you believe you have, how would you react? Would you be curious, skeptical, amused—or even a little shaken?"

  "Session 2: Pets, Health, and Happiness 🐕🐈": {
    "context": "Pets have been part of human life for thousands of years—bringing comfort, joy, and sometimes chaos! Whether it’s walking a dog, watching fish swim, or cuddling with a cat, many people say pets make life better. But could they also make us healthier? In this session, let’s explore how pets impact our lives, share meaningful stories, and reflect on what it means to care for (or be cared for by) another creature.",
    "questions": [
      "Have you ever had a pet, or do you know someone close to you who has one? What kind of pet was it, and what was it like being around them?",
      "What do you think are some benefits of having a pet—emotionally, socially, or even physically?",
      "Do you believe pets can actually help people live healthier or longer lives? Why or why not?",
      "Taking care of a pet also comes with responsibilities. What challenges or sacrifices do you think pet owners face, and how do they balance them with the rewards?",
      "If you could create the perfect 'life-enhancing' pet—real or imaginary—what would it be like? What would it do for you, and how would it fit into your lifestyle?"
