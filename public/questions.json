    "context": "This session explores how extended life expectancy, shifting cultural attitudes, and economic realities are redefining retirement and inspiring people to pursue second careers. Using the film 'The Intern' as a springboard, the conversation delves into the opportunities and challenges of age-diverse workplaces, highlighting how intergenerational teams can foster mentorship, mutual learning, and innovation.",
    "questions": [
      "Have you ever met someone who changed careers later in life—or thought about doing that yourself someday? What motivated the change?",
      "In your opinion, what strengths do older professionals bring to modern workplaces? What might they struggle with in today’s fast-paced, tech-driven environment?",
      "How do you think younger and older coworkers can support each other at work? Can you think of examples where such teamwork led to surprising outcomes?",
      "As people live and work longer, how should companies adapt? Should there be new roles or systems for mentoring, flexible schedules, or senior internships?",
      "Imagine you’re mentoring someone 30 years older—or younger—than you. What unique insights or skills would you want to exchange?"

  "Session 2: Dopa, Sero, Teto, Egen—Which Type Speaks to You? 🔤😄": {
    "context": "Based on Dr. Helen Fisher’s research into the brain’s chemistry of love, this session dives into how our dominant neurotransmitters and hormones—Dopamine, Serotonin, Testosterone, and Estrogen—shape romantic behavior and compatibility. Participants are invited to identify their 'love personality,' share personal stories, and reflect on how these brain types influence attraction, relationship dynamics, and dating adventures.",
    "questions": [
      "If you had to guess—are you more of a thrill-seeker in love, a planner, a logical type, or someone who deeply values emotional connection? Why do you think that fits you?",
      "Can you share a funny or memorable moment from a past date that totally reflects your 'love personality'? (e.g. Did you plan everything? Go on a spontaneous adventure? Send a long heartfelt message?)",
      "Which of the four types—Dopamine, Serotonin, Testosterone, or Estrogen—do you think you'd have the most fun dating? And which one would drive you crazy?",
      "Do you think love is more about similarity (like Dopa-Dopa couples) or about balancing each other’s differences (like Teto-Egen couples)? Which do you personally prefer in relationships?",
      "Imagine a romantic comedy starring each of the four types—what kind of storylines or couple drama would each one have? Feel free to get creative or silly!"
